						<h2>The Objective</h2>
						<p>Rodeo Networks came to me in 2015 looking for a designer who could work remotely and provide quick and efficient design work with little artistic direction. Most of what I designed was marketed to users who knew the ins and outs of terminology like "WISP" and "IPTV". Even so, they wanted to come across as a fun but reliable brand that prides themselves as being a step above the competition in both product quality and customer service.</p>

							<p>The first project I did for Rodeo was a tri-fold brochure detailing their services and bundles. During this first foray into the brand's image, I was challenged with the task of vectorizing some commissioned illustrations in order to make them large enough to print.</p>

              <p>Shortly after, Rodeo needed a clean but engaging double-sided flyer design for a show they were attending to advertise their product to other TV providers and their customers. I was able to compile a large amount of information into a small space while maintaining readability as well as keeping the design cohesive with the brand image.</p>

	              <p>Most recently, I created a series of ads for Rodeo's presence at WISPAmerica 2018. Their mission for this particular show was to advertise that RodeoTV is on a level of its own with tons of unique features that potential future customers can try out at their show booth, with an emphasis on IPTV.</p>

            <h2>The Results</h2>
              <p>Rodeo's professional and upbeat designs stand out among the bland corporate aesthetic of many of their competitors. Since I began work for them, the company has blossomed into not just a booming local service but a country-wide enterprise with customers in several major cities from Seattle to Miami.</p>
