						<h2>The Objective</h2>
						<p>I have always loved the idea of creating fantasy worlds and experiencing them through writing games. When I was 14, I joined my first text-based role playing forum, and the rest is history. I made a few maps for my own use, and then expanded my hobby a bit to include commissions from online clients. These are ordered from oldest to newest, so be sure to scroll all the way to the bottom to see my newest maps!</p>

                <h3>Eleutheria</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Eleutheria was the name of a continent that was created over many years by a community of role players I used to write with. After playing the game for about a year, I decided I wanted to try my hand at map-making to show how much I loved the game and to help the other players visualize the distance between lands.</p>

                <h3>Obascus</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Obascus was a spin-off role playing game I tried to make using one of the lands I created in Eleutheria. The game itself never took off, but I liked how the map zoomed in on the land and showed all of the smaller areas of the valley.</p>

                <h3>Zombie Apocalypse Denver</h3>
							</header>
							<p>One of my first map commissions. Someone was creating an RPG set in a post-apocalyptic Denver, Colorado. I did my best to make this map look dingy and bloodied-up, but also clear, crisp, and informative.</p>

                <h3>Erra</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Erra was my attempt at creating another small-land-area RPG. This is one of the only maps I have ever made that didn't feature an ocean coastline. I challenged myself to not use any brush sets and only draw and photo-manipulate textures to create the effects I wanted.</p>

								<a href="images/map5.jpg" data-lightbox="map5"><img src="images/mythos.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                <h3>Mythos</h3>
							</header>
							<p>One of the largest map commissions I have recieved thus far, Mythos is a re-creation of the lands in an older RPG from around a decade ago. Many of the places that were once green and plentiful were total wastelands, and other places that had never been seen before rose up out of the ocean. It was a really fun project, and one of my favorite maps I've ever made!</p>

                <h3>Eternal (Sol & Noc)</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This is my newest map, a set of three islands for an RPG called Eternal. In this game, one island is in a state of eternal daytime (Sol) and one in eternal night (Noc). The middle island experiences the days and nights normally, and houses large shrines for the gods of the lands. I really enjoyed this project a lot!</p>

            <h2>The Results</h2>
              <p>I had a lot of fun creating these maps, and made a little money from making them, too. I am planning to create map "adoptables" that are pre-made land areas that people can purchase from me to use for their games.</p>
