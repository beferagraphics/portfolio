						<h2>The Objective</h2>
						<p>Nadeen's Hermitage Haven is a diner-style restaurant on the border of Donelson and Hermitage. I worked with the restaurant's three owners to create a full branding experience for their target market. The owners were looking for a brand that encompassed a "hick" vibe as well as a "hispster" aesthetic to attract a wider range of customers and to show off their personal passion and interests.</p>

							<p>The first thing I created to solidify the brand aesthetic was the diner's logo. The image above showcases some early concepts.</p>

              <p>The colors we chose for the final logo were aimed to be indicative of the diner's versatility as the perfect morning breakfast spot as well as a great location to indulge in the neighborhood's night life.</p>

              <p>Next, I designed a horizontal "placemat-style" menu as the restaurant's first foray into the cozy, diner-style atmosphere.</p>

              <p>About a year later, I redesigned the menu to better suit the growing and changing restaurant's needs. I tried out a vertical menu style, and it was a huge improvement to the overall ordering experience.</p>

          <!-- Results -->

            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>Nadeen's is now a popular breakfast, lunch, and dinner destination for locals in the growing Donelson/Hermitage area as well as tourists visiting Nashville year-round. The message of the brand was conveyed as intended and attracted the business's target audience as well as others who weren't in our taret market but appreciated the brand's authenticity and commitment to fresh food and good company.</p>
